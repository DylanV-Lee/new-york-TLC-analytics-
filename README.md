# 1. Title & Introduction
Title: "Analysis of Factors Influencing Sodium-to-Potassium (Na_to_K) Ratios in Health Data"
Introduction:
Briefly explain the context of the dataset (health factors: Na_to_K ratio, age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels).
Mention the purpose of the analysis: to explore which factors (e.g., sex, BP) significantly influence Na_to_K levels and provide insights for health-related decisions.
Explain why this is valuable (e.g., personalized health or drug recommendations).
# 2. Dataset Overview
Dataset Description:
Describe the key variables: Na_to_K (target), Sex, Age, BP, Cholesterol, etc.
Provide some descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for important variables.
Data Cleaning:
If any preprocessing or cleaning steps were performed, include them here (e.g., handling missing values, outlier removal).
# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations:
Include visualizations such as histograms, box plots, or bar plots to show distributions of key variables like Na_to_K by Sex, BP, etc.
Comment on any patterns or trends noticed (e.g., higher Na_to_K in one gender).
Summary:
A quick summary of insights gained from EDA (e.g., "Males seem to have higher Na_to_K levels on average compared to females").
# 4. Statistical Analysis
ANOVA Analysis:
Explain the purpose of the ANOVA: to check if factors like Sex, BP, and Cholesterol significantly affect Na_to_K levels.
Present the ANOVA table and highlight significant results (e.g., "Sex is a significant factor influencing Na_to_K levels with 
ùëù
=
0.038
p=0.038").
# Regression Analysis:
Describe the multiple regression model used (dependent variable: Na_to_K, independent variables: Sex, Age, BP).
Present the coefficients and interpret them (e.g., "Males tend to have a higher Na_to_K ratio, while BP also plays a role").
# Logistic Regression for Drug Prediction:
Briefly explain the logistic regression model used for predicting drug classification based on Na_to_K and other variables.
Interpret the coefficients and odds ratios.
